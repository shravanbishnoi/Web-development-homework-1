# React Chat Bot Interface
This project is a React-based chat interface where a user can send messages and interact with a simple bot. The bot performs random text transformations on the user's messages and responds within the chat interface. This chat app mimics the look and feel of popular messaging platforms like Discord or Slack and demonstrates various text manipulation techniques.

## Features
- User Input and Bot Response: The user sends a message, and the bot replies with a transformed version of the message.
- Random Text Transformations: The bot randomly applies one of five transformations to the user’s input:
  - Counting the total number of characters.
  - Counting the number of vowels and consonants.
  - Counting the number of words.
  - Replacing spaces with underscores.
  - Reversing the text.
  - Converting text to uppercase.
  - Converting text to lowercase.

- Simple, Intuitive UI: The chat interface resembles modern chat apps and is styled to distinguish between the user’s messages and the bot’s responses.
- Scroll Feature: The chat history can scroll as messages are added, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Basic Input Validation: The user cannot submit an empty or invalid message.
- Random Bot Name: The bot's name changes with every message, adding variety to the chat experience.
- Theme: User can switch themes between light and dark.
